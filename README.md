# DATA-ANALYSIS-PYTHON-PROJECT-BLINKIT-ANALYSIS
This project is a data analysis case study on Blinkit (formerly Grofers), built using Python. The notebook demonstrates the complete data analysis workflow, including:<br>
**- Data Import & Cleaning** – Loading raw dataset, handling missing values, and preparing data for analysis.<br>
**- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding the dataset with descriptive statistics and visualizations. <br>
**- Data Insights** – Identifying trends, product demand patterns, and sales performance across categories.<br>
**- Visualizations** – Using matplotlib and seaborn to create charts for better interpretation of insights.<br>
**- Business Understanding** – Deriving key takeaways that can help in decision-making, such as product popularity, pricing effects, and inventory considerations.<br>
**Tech Stack:**<br>
- Python <br>
- Pandas <br>
- NumPy <br>
- Matplotlib <br>
- Seaborn <br>
- Jupyter Notebook <br>
This project highlights how data-driven insights can optimize operations and improve business decisions for online retail platforms like Blinkit
